### Disclaimer
This is not the original repo, it's a forked repo, the original one got taken down, last commit [here](https://github.com/xjunko/FurinaImpact/tree/fc2505755f75f59f1f34a9fb471ffe62bc571061). <br/>
Only thing that's different here is that it builds itself daily from the new (hopefully free from dmca) repo.<br/>
